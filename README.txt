# ETL Task

Breakdown of executing the ETL task:

Begin by verifying Python and pip installation using python --version and pip --version in your terminal.

If errors occur, download and install Python from python.org, ensuring you add it to your PATH.

Navigate to the directory containing requirements.txt and main.py using the cd command.
type the command and press Enter- 
command- pip install -r requirements.txt

This command ensures your project has all the dependencies it needs to function correctly.

Execute the ETL script main.py by typing  
command - python main.py' in the terminal and press Enter.

The main.py script will then perform the defined Extract, Transform, and Load operations.

The script's output may vary, potentially displaying results in the console or writing to files or databases.

If you encounter module not found errors, double check the pip install command was successful.

Review console error messages and the main.py code for troubleshooting.
